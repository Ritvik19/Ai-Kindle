**Welcome to AI-Kindle!**

This app helps you read PDFs, extract text, take notes, and interact with an AI assistant based on the document content.

**1. Upload a PDF:**
    - Click "Browse files" or drag and drop your PDF into the box above.
    - Wait for the app to process the PDF (extraction and reformatting). A progress bar will show the status.

**2. Navigate Pages:**
    - Once processed, the first page image and its text will appear.
    - Use the "‚¨ÖÔ∏è Previous Page" and "Next Page ‚û°Ô∏è" buttons below the main content area to move through the document.
    - The current page number is displayed between the buttons.

**3. View Text:**
    - The middle column ("üìñ Page Text") shows the text extracted and reformatted from the current page.
    - You can manually **copy text** from this box.

**4. Interact & Take Notes:**
    - **Select Text:** Copy the text you're interested in from the "üìñ Page Text" box.
    - **Paste Text:** Paste the copied text into the "Paste selected text or enter page context..." area in the right column ("üí¨ Interaction").
    - **Save Highlight:** Click "üìå Save Selected Text as Note" to save the pasted text as a highlight note, linked to the current page. The pasted text area will clear.

**5. Ask the AI:**
    - **Provide Context:**
        - **Option A (Selected Text):** Paste the relevant text into the "Paste selected text or enter page context..." area.
        - **Option B (Specific Pages):** Type `@` followed by page numbers or ranges (e.g., `@1`, `@3-5`, `@1,3,5-7`). This tells the AI to use the text from those specific pages.
        - **Option C (All Pages):** Leave the context area **empty**. The AI will use the text from the *entire* document (may be slow for large PDFs).
    - **Enter Question:** Type your question about the provided context (pasted text or specified pages) into the "Enter your question..." input box.
    - **Get Answer:** Click "‚ùì Ask AI". The AI's response will appear below.
    - **Save AI Response:** If the response is helpful, click "üíæ Save AI Response as Note" to save the question and answer.

**6. Manage Notes:**
    - All saved highlights and AI responses appear in the "üìù My Notes" section at the bottom.
    - Notes are displayed in columns.
    - Click "‚ùå Delete Note" to remove a specific note.
    - Click "üì• Export Notes to TXT" to download all your notes as a text file.

**Tips:**
- Text reformatting during PDF processing uses an AI and might take a moment per page.
- AI responses can also take a few seconds, especially with large contexts.
- If you upload a new PDF, your current notes will be cleared. Export them first if needed!
